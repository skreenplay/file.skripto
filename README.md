Scripto - screenplay files
=====

This is my attempt at making a file format for script writing, this repository is a list of basic items that, in my mind, are needed for generating a good screenplay or script.

# In action

`.skripto` files are used in the program Scripto, which is in very early development. But still, if you're interested, [check out Scripto](https://github.com/the-duck/scripto-desktop)

# An exploration of screen writing

I'm not gonna lie, this project started off because I wanted to learn how to write screenplays, given its relative complexity. There was also some frustration in the fact that there's no open-source software for that, and most programs are pretty expensive.
But yeah, it's like an exploration of the way stories are written nowadays, and an exploration of how software can influence the way we create.
Check out some of the [ideas in mind](docs/0.0.3/ideas.md)

## Current version : 0.0.3

[Here's](docs/0.0.3/file.md) how a file looks like, but the main piece of information is in the expressions that define the script [there](docs/0.0.3/expressions.md).
