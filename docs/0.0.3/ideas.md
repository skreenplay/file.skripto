Ideas for Scripto
====

These are global ideas, or rather goals, for the filetype, as well as the desktop app that cannot be separated from it.

## Global ideas

1. Complete coverage of the script/screenplay standard

    This is already a big task because of the strict nature of screenplays.

2. Integrate with other programs (open-source if possible) and filetypes (.celtx?), to be present in a workflow

    The priority is to save to PDF, to word documents (if possible), other.

3. LONG-TERM : Story Schema

    It would be a visual representation of the story where concepts like events, states (personal, or general), evolution, etc.. could be integrated with the script. I would see it more as a stage before actually scriptwriting.

4. LONG-TERM : Inspiration integration

    Ability to integrate inspiration elements, like images, links, and litterature sources... Create a thematic dashboard of inspiration items.


## Tasks - not included in version 0.0.3 :

- add `addScriptItem()`
- add `removeScriptItem()`
- Add extra variables to item list (right now it's ignored)
- Review error handling in whole library.
